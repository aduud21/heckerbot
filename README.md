# Installation

This bot runs on node.js. You will need at least node 16.18.1

Make sure your bot has Message Content Intent enabled else you'll get a error.

This bot runs on replit (hosted there) and it is recommended to run it there.

NOTE: IF THERES A ERROR IN YOUR CODE OR SUCH, PLEASE REVIEW YOURSELF AND IF YOU SEE ANY throw new error PAY ATTENTION TO THAT AND SEE THE REASON

## How to run the bot on replit
Secrets are environment variables (on replit you can create secrets by using it's bulit-in gui)

You'll need your bot token.

[![Import this project to replit](https://replit.com/badge?caption=Import%20this%20project%20to%20Replit)](https://replit.com/github/aduud21/heckerbot) or download the latest github [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/aduud21/heckerbot?include_prereleases=&sort=semver)](https://github.com/aduud21/heckerbot/releases/) (github release is recommanded as it is likely more stable).

Make sure to run

```js
npm install
```

Create a secret named TOKEN and value as the token of your bot.

## MongoDB:
1. You'll need a [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) database set up. Make sure you have 0.0.0.0 whitelisted in the IP addresses so it will work with Replit or such
2. Create a secret called mongodb and put your database's connection URI in there. It should look something like this: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.clusters.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Don't use the example I provided, put your own, it won't work. If you don't have a MongoDB, you can create on at [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/).

## UptimeRobot:
(This is a modified guide of [devspen 24/7 hosting replit](https://github.com/DevSpen/24-7_hosting_replit#uptimerobot) to work with the latest changes of replit)

i will be using [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) as the monitoring system.

1. Copy the URL of the website that shows when you run the repl. If you are on mobile, this will be on the "Output" tab; on Desktop, you'll see it in the upper right corner of your screen:

## Not done yet, for some slashcommands, go in guildEvents folder then guildCreate file and modify clientUSERID (line 2) to your bot's userID/APPLICATION ID.

After doing this, in events folder (ready.js) you can turn off/on start_up_message (by default it is off), if you want start up messages then:

Replace 957439649142407248 with the channel you want it to send (channel id)

```js
client.channels.cache.get("957439649142407248");
```
