# New contributor guide

This project is about a discord bot that I made

## Some useful links:

### Before requesting your changes to the main project, be sure to review your code and make sure it works!

#### Be sure its formatted well and not ugly code, ugly code is basically unnecessary extra things in the code, for example you add a lot of unnecessary lines in the code, that would be like this:

```js
const look = require("thisisjustaexample");



console.log("hi");
```

or all the code in one line:

```js
const lol = require("discord.js"), console.log("hi")

```
